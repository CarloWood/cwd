  //
  // [Paragraph 8.2.5]
  // ...
  //   The SFENCE, LFENCE, and MFENCE instructions provide a performance-efficient way of ensuring load and store
  //   memory ordering between routines that produce weakly-ordered results and routines that consume that data. The
  //   functions of these instructions are as follows:
  // [...]
  //   LFENCE — Serializes all load (read) operations that occurred prior to the LFENCE instruction in the program
  //   instruction stream, but does not affect store operations.2
  // [...]
  //   2. Specifically, LFENCE does not execute until all prior instructions have completed locally, and no later instruction begins execution
  //   until LFENCE completes. As a result, an instruction that loads from memory and that precedes an LFENCE receives data from memory
  //   prior to completion of the LFENCE. An LFENCE that follows an instruction that stores to memory might complete before the data
  //   being stored have become globally visible. Instructions following an LFENCE may be fetched from memory before the LFENCE, but
  //   they will not execute until the LFENCE completes.
  //
  //
  // [Paragraph 8.3]
  // ...
  //   The Intel 64 and IA-32 architectures define several serializing instructions. These instructions force the
  //   processor to complete all modifications to flags, registers, and memory by previous instructions and to drain all
  //   buffered writes to memory before the next instruction is fetched and executed.
  // [...]
  //   * Non-privileged serializing instructions — CPUID, IRET, and RSM.
  // [...]
  //   When the processor serializes instruction execution, it ensures that all pending memory transactions are
  //   completed (including writes stored in its store buffer) before it executes the next instruction. Nothing can pass a
  //   serializing instruction and a serializing instruction cannot pass any other instruction (read, write, instruction fetch,
  //   or I/O). For example, CPUID can be executed at any privilege level to serialize instruction execution with no effect
  //   on program flow, except that the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers are modified.
