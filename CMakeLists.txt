# The root project must use 'FILEPATH "cwm4/cmake/hunter-config.cmake"' in its HunterGate call. For example,
#
# HunterGate(

#    SHA1 "........................................"
#     FILEPATH "cwm4/cmake/hunter-config.cmake"

# We depend on these even when utils is not part of the project.

# Compile with -pthread.

# debug_ostream_operators.h: #include <boost/shared_ptr.hpp>
#                            #include <boost/weak_ptr.hpp>

# If utils is part of the project then we depend on it only if EnableDebugGlobal is ON.
# However, utils depends on cwds. To avoid a circular dependency we do never include
# the dependcy on AICxx::utils. This is ok because utils is an OBJECT library and
# adding a dependency on it here would only cause its INTERFACE to be inherited,
# which happens to be Threads and Boost, which we depend on anyway, which the include
# directory of utils is the same as that for sys.h and debug.h, so we should get that
# too already (this means however that utils MUST be in project root, as does cwds).
